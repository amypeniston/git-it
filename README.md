A readme explains what the project is, how to use it, and often times, how to contribute.
Sometimes there is an extra file called CONTRIBUTING.md for those details.

A .gitignore is a list of files that Git should not track, i.e. files with passwords or sensitive info.

A license file is the type of license you allocate on your project. See choosealicense.com.
